	leOS2.h - <l>ittle <e>mbedded <O>perating <S>ystem 2

    leOS2 is a simple scheduler to execute little routines in background,
    at specific intervals. leOS2 comes from leOS but instead of using
    an internal timer like leOS, it is based on the WatchDog Timer,
    a separated counter that is attached to an internal oscillator
    clocked at 128 kHz.

    For more infos, please read the README.txt file.
